# kickstart.nvim

## Introduction

A starting point for Neovim that is:

* Small
* Single-file
* Completely Documented

**NOT** a Neovim distribution, but instead a starting point for your configuration.

This is my personal neovim config, forked from kickstart.nvim
major changes to the default include the modularisation of plugins, and changes to completion and LSP implimentation.
